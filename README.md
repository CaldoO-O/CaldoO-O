## üßë About Me

I'm currently pursuing a degree in **Mechatronics/Automation Engineering** at Universidade de Bras√≠lia (UnB), where I've been developing my skills and passion for robotics and automation since early 2023. My journey in technology started back in 2020 with self-taught studies in **Arduino** programming, which pushed me forward on the path I'm following today.
